# Neovimrc

## Setup

### Packer

Install packer somewhere in your `packpath`:
```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
    ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Once packer has been installed for the first time, it will manage itself as any other packer plugin.
